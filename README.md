Notes on mistakes made in Web Design
http://www.nngroup.com/

1. Bad Search - keep it simple the search box is what people are looking for and when queries are put in they should display "best bets" to help the user select the item to search regardless of spelling and typos
2. PDF Files for Online Reading - PDF is not set up for on-line reading and are hard to navigate.  Good for printing.  But bad for scrolling and layouts are not optimized.
3. Not Changing the color of visited links - "A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand our current location, since it's the culmination of your journey." If you are aware you've already been there then you know if you want to go again.
4. Non-Scannable text - Write of online not for putting it in print
    * subheads
    * bulleted lists
    * highlighted keywords
    * short paragraphs
    * the inverted pyramid
    * a simple writing style, and
    * de-fluffed language devoid of marketese
    Eyetracking for Reading Patterns show that users often read Web pages in an F-shaped pattern: two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.
5.  Fixed Font Size - Set CSS font sizes in relative terms and not in an absolute number of pixels so users can resize text as needed
6.  Page Titles with low Searh Engine Visibility - The <title> tag is almost always used for clickable headline for search - Don't use words like "The" or "Welcome"
